## Closeness Sensor for Rasperry Pi
This set up allows the distance sensor to have flashing LEDs when the distance gets withing certain parameters once the button is pushed. The flashing red light starts when distance is between 10 to 15cm.   Then flashing red and blue lights at .25 seconds when distance is between 5 to 10cm. Finally flashing red and blue lights at .1 seconds when distance is 5cm or less.
